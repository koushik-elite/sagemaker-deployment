# Amazon Sagemaker deployment - Udacity Nanodegree Project
Deploying a Pytorch model in Amazon Sagemaker and access it through open endpoint Amazon Lambda function

## Creating a Sentiment Analysis Web App
### Using PyTorch and SageMaker
Deep Learning Nanodegree Program | Deployment

Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.

The project is completely build on Notebook click here to view documentation [documentation](/report.md)
